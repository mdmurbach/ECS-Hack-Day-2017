# ECS Hack Day 2017

Welcome to the main git repository for the ECS Hack Day at the 232<sup>nd</sup> ECS Meeting in National Harbor, MD.

The [OSF project page](https://osf.io/z4xkn/) is the central location for all of the project pages, datasets, and general information. The contents of this repository mostly pertain to the morning sessions:
- Dan's slides introducing electrochemistry + data science
- David and Matt's intro to git slides
- Small example project for working with git repositories
